# PiciGL
Very small footprint (about 1k gzipped) WebGL framework. For code golfing, js13k, or if you like minimal code.
Theese are just wrapper functions for common webgl tasks - not an easy to use framework.

A small example here (drawing a triangle to a framebuffer, and applying a postprocess on that):

BTW, 'Pici' means 'tiny' in hungarian :)
